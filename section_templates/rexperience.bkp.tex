    {The Effect of Nonprofits on High School Graduation}
    {Williamstown, MA}
    {Summer 2015}
    {
      \begin{cvitems}
%      \item {Instrumented using data on the friendliness towards nonprofits to find causal evidence between the number of nonprofits and the public high school graduation rate}
      \item {Awarded a \$5,000 Sentinels Research Fellowship to find a causal relationship between the number of local educational nonprofits and educational outcomes using the region's friendliness towards nonprofits as an IV}
      \item {Constructed panel data in R containing ten years of graduation rates, local GDP, local unemployment, count of nonprofits, count of educational nonprofits, and a few more controls at the MSA level}
      \item {Found a strong, positive correlation between educational nonprofits and the graduation rate controlling for GDP, unemployment, and metropolitan statistical area fixed effects using STATA}

    {Brands and Self-certification: Evidence from Organics in Vietnam}
    {Saigon, Vietnam}
    {January 2016}
    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Found that farms must go to great expense to self-certify organic produce in the absence of a reputable certifier and must ship produce directly to assure that the customer does not receive counterfeit goods}
        \item {Worked with a partner to collect data on the price of organic and inorganic strawberries in local markets and found a 500\% price premium when controlling for location and sale venue in STATA}
        \item {Collected data on fixed costs of automated organic strawberry farming and found they paid for themselves in less than one year and that potential farmers had easy access to capital from Japanese investors}

    {Truck Accidents and Sleep Deprivation}
    {Williamstown, MA}
    {Aug 2015 - Aug 2016}
    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Found a small effect of hours hours of sleep on fatal truck accidents using STATA using differences in differences with two regulation changes as natural experiments}
        \item{Wrote scripts to convert data frames and calendars between various formats in R and constructed 15 years worth of fatal truck collision data, temperatures, holidays, weather patterns, and vehicle safety features}
        \item {Used differences in differences analysis with Quebec truck fatalities data I obtained by contacting Société de l'assurance automobile du Québec -- regulation changes effected drivers in the US only}

        \item {Constructing models of several failures that can occur in relational contracts with a mill and a coffee farmer to find solutions that improve the stability end efficiency of relational contracts}
