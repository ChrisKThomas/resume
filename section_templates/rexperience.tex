      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Found a small effect of hours of sleep on fatal truck accidents using differences in differences with two regulation changes as policy experiments}
        \item {Used differences in differences analysis with Québec truck fatalities data I obtained by contacting Société de l'assurance automobile du Québec -- US regulation changes affected drivers in the US only}

    {Brands and Self-certification: Evidence from Organics in Vietnam}
    {Saigon, Vietnam}
    {January 2016}
    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Consistant with the literature of reputation building in repeated games, found that farms go to great expense to self-certify organic produce in the absence of a reputable certifier and ship produce directly to assure that the customer does not receive counterfeit goods}
        \item {Worked with a partner to collect data on the price of organic and inorganic strawberries in local markets and found a 500\% price premium when controlling for location and sale venue}
        \item {Collected data on fixed costs of automated organic strawberry farming and found they paid for themselves in less than one year and that potential farmers had easy access to capital from Japanese investors}

    {The Effect of Nonprofits on High School Graduation}
    {Williamstown, MA}
    {Summer 2015}
    {
      \begin{cvitems}
%      \item {Instrumented using data on the friendliness towards nonprofits to find causal evidence between the number of nonprofits and the public high school graduation rate}
      \item {Found evidence of a causal relationship between the number of local educational nonprofits and graduation rates using the region's friendliness towards nonprofits as an IV}
      \item {Constructed panel data in R containing ten years of graduation rates, local GDP, local unemployment, count of nonprofits, count of educational nonprofits, and a few more controls at the MSA level}
      \item {Found a strong, positive correlation between educational nonprofits and the graduation rate controlling for GDP, unemployment, and metropolitan statistical area fixed effects}
